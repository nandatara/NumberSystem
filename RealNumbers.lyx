\begin_layout Quote

\emph on
The foundation on which the structure of higher analysis rests is the theory
 of real numbers.
 Any strict treatment of the foundations of the differential and integral
 calculus and of related subjects must inevitably start from there.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rational numbers can be represented by points on a line.
 We shall see that there are gaps in this number line which will be filled
 by irrational numbers.
 The aggregate of rational and irrational numbers constitute the real number
 system.
 Rational numbers have a terminating or recurring decimal representation
 whereas irrational numbers have an infinite non-recurring and non-terminating
 decimal representation.
 A formal construction of the real number system will be taken up in subsequent
 sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Rational numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Positive Integers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It was to the numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,3,4,$
\end_inset

 etc.
 that we were first introduced through the process of 
\emph on
counting
\emph default
 certain objects.
 The totality of these numbers is known as the aggregate of 
\emph on
natural numbers
\emph default
, 
\emph on
whole numbers
\emph default
 or 
\emph on
positive integers
\emph default
.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

While the operations of addition and multiplications are possible in relation
 to the aggregate of positive integers, this is not the case in respect
 of the inverse operations of subtraction and division.
 Thus, for example, the symbols
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
2-3,\,2\div3
\]

\end_inset

are meaningless in respect of the aggregate of positive integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fractional numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a later stage, another class of numbers like 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 (e.g., 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4}$
\end_inset

) where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 are natural numbers, was added to the former class.
 This is known as the class of fractions and it obviously includes natural
 numbers as a sub-class: 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 being equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 in this case.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The introduction of fractional numbers is motivated, from an abstract point
 of view, to render division  possible and, from concrete point of view,
 to render numbers serviceable for measurement also in addition to counting.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rational numbers.
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Rational-numbers."

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Still later, the class of numbers was enlarged by incorporating in it the
 class of negative fractions including negative integers and zero.
 The entire aggregate of these numbers is known as the 
\emph on
aggregate of rational numbers
\emph default
.
 Every rational number is expressible as 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 are any two integers, positive or negative and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is not zero.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The introduction of negative numbers is motivated, from an abstract point
 of view to render subtraction always possible and, from concrete point
 of view, to facilitate a unified treatment of oppositely directed pairs
 of entities such as, gain and loss, rise and fall, etc.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Fundamental operations on rational numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An important property of the aggregate of rational numbers is that the operation
s of addition, multiplication, subtraction and division can be performed
 upon any two such numbers, (with one 
\emph on
exception
\emph default
 which is considered below in subsection 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Meaningless-operation-of"

\end_inset

 ) and the number obtained as the result of these operations is again a
 rational number.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This property is expressed by saying that the aggregate of rational numbers
 is 
\emph on
closed
\emph default
 with respect to the four fundamental operations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:Meaningless-operation-of"

\end_inset

Meaningless operation of division by zero.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It is important to note that the only exception to the above property is
 `division by zero' which is a meaningless operation.
 This may be seen as follows :--
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

To divide 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

 amounts to determining a number 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 such that
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
bc=a
\]

\end_inset

and the division will be intelligible only, if and only if, the determination
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $c$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
uniquely possible
\emph default
.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Now, there is no number which when multiplied by zero produces a number
 other than zero so that a 
\begin_inset Formula $a/0$
\end_inset

 is 
\emph on
no
\emph default
 number when 
\begin_inset Formula $a\neq0$
\end_inset

.
 Also any number when multiplied by zero produces zero so that 
\begin_inset Formula $0/0$
\end_inset

 may be 
\emph on
any
\emph default
 number.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

On account of this 
\emph on
impossibility
\emph default
 in one case and 
\emph on
indefiniteness
\emph default
 in the other, the operation of division by zero must be always avoided.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

A disregard of this exception often leads to absurd results as is illustrated
 below in 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "enu:excep"

\end_inset

.

\end_inset

 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x=6.$
\end_inset

 Then
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x^{2}-36 & = & x-6,\\
\mbox{or }(x-6)(x+6) & = & x-6.
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset


\emph on
Dividing both sides
\emph default
 by 
\begin_inset Formula $x-6$
\end_inset

, we get
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
x+6 & = & 1,\\
6+6 & = & 1,\mbox{ \emph{i.e, \ensuremath{\mbox{\ensuremath{12}=\ensuremath{1}}.}}}
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

which is clearly absurd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We may also remark in this connection that
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\frac{x^{2}-36}{x-6}=\frac{\left(x-6\right)\left(x+6\right)}{\left(x-6\right)}=x+6,\mbox{ only when \ensuremath{x\neq6.}}\label{eq:divbyzero}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

For 
\begin_inset Formula $x=6,$
\end_inset

 the left hand expression 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x^{2}-36\right)/\left(x-6\right)$
\end_inset

, is meaning-less whereas the right hand expression, 
\begin_inset Formula $x+6,$
\end_inset

 is equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $12$
\end_inset

 so that the equality ceases to hold for 
\begin_inset Formula $x=6.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The equality (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:divbyzero"

\end_inset

) above is proved by dividing the numerator and denominator of the fraction
 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x^{2}-36\right)/\left(x-6\right)$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x-6\right)$
\end_inset

 and this operation of division is possible when the divisor 
\begin_inset Formula $\left(x-6\right)\neq0,$
\end_inset

 
\emph on
i.e.
\emph default
, when 
\begin_inset Formula $x\neq6.$
\end_inset

 This explains the 
\emph on
restricted
\emph default
 character of the equality (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:divbyzero"

\end_inset

).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Exercise
Show that the aggregate of natural numbers is not closed with respect to
 the operations of subtraction and division.
 Also show that the aggregate of positive fractions is not closed with respect
 to the operations of subtraction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example

\emph on
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "recurring"

\end_inset

Show that every rational number is expressible as a terminating or a recurring
 decimal.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Example
To decimalize 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

, we have first to divide 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 and then each remainder, after multiplication with 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

, is to be divided by 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 to obtain the successive figures in the decimal expression of 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

.
 The decimal expression will be terminating if, at some stage, the remainder
 vanishes.
 Otherwise, the process will be unending.
 In the latter case, the remainder will always be one of the finite set
 of numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,\ldots,q-1$
\end_inset

 and so must repeat itself at some stage.
 From this stage onward, the quotients will also repeat themselves and the
 decimal expression will, therefore, be recurring.

\begin_inset Formula $x$

\begin_layout Subsection
Representation of rational numbers by points along a line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mode of representing rational numbers by points along a line or by segments
 of a line, which may be known as the 
\emph on
number axis
\emph default
, will now be explained.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We start with marking an arbitrary point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 on the number axis and calling it the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 or zero point.
 The number zero will be represented by the point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 divides the number axis into two parts or sides.
 Any one of these may be called positive and the other, then negative.
 Usually, the number axis is drawn parallel to the printed lines of the
 page and the right hand side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is termed positive and the left hand side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 negative.

On the positive side, we take an arbitrary length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

, and call it the 
\emph on
unit
\emph default
 length.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We say, then, that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 is represented by the point 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

After having fixed an 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
, 
\emph on
positive sense
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
unit length
\emph default
 on the number axis in the manner indicated above, we are in a position
 to determine a point representing any given rational number as explained
 below :--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Positive integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we consider any positive integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 We take a point on the positive side of the line such that its distance
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times the unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

.
 This point will be reached by measuring successively 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 steps each equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 This point, then, is said to represent the positive integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Negative integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To represent a negative integer,
\begin_inset Formula $-m$
\end_inset

, we take a point on the negative side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 such that its distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times the unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This point represents the negative integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $-m$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fractions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 be any fraction ; 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 being a positive integer.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

 be divided into 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 equal parts; 
\begin_inset Formula $OB$
\end_inset

 being one of them.
 We take a point on the positive or negative side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 according as 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is positive or negative such that its distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 times (or, 
\begin_inset Formula $-p$
\end_inset

 times if 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is negative) the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $OB$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The point so obtained represents the fraction, 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If a point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 represents a rational number 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

, then the measure of the length 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

 is clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-p/q$
\end_inset

 according as the number is positive or negative.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Sometimes we say that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 is represented by the segment 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Section
Irrational numbers.
 Real numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have seen in the last article that every rational number can be represented
 by a point of a line.
 Also, it is easy, to see that we can cover the line with such points as

 The natural question now arises, ``Is the converse true ?'' Is it possible
 to assign a rational number to every point of the number-axis? A simple
 consideration, as detailed below, will clearly show that it is not so.

Construct a square each of whose sides is equal to the unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

 and take a point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 on the number-axis such that 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

 is equal in the length to the diagonal of the square.
 It will now be shown that the point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 cannot correspond to a rational number i.e., the length of 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

 cannot have a rational number as its measure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If possible, let its measure be a rational number 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 so that, by Pythagoras' theorem, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{2}=1^{2}+1^{2}=2,\mbox{ \emph{i.e.}, \ensuremath{p^{2}=2q^{2}.}}\label{eq:irr}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may suppose that 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 have no common factor, for, such factors, if any, can be canceled to begin
 with.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly we notice that
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left(2n\right)^{2}=4n^{2},\left(2n+1\right)^{2}=\left(4n^{2}+4n\right)+1
\]

\end_inset

so that the square of an even number is even and that of an odd number is
 odd.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From the equation (
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:irr"

\end_inset

), we see, that 
\begin_inset Formula $p^{2}$
\end_inset

 is an even number.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Therefore, 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 itself must be even.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let, then 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 be equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $2n$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 is an integer.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore\qquad4n^{2}=2q^{2}\mbox{ or \ensuremath{q^{2}=2n^{2}.}}
\]

\end_inset

Thus, 
\begin_inset Formula $q^{2}$
\end_inset

 is also even and so 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 is even.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 have a common factor 
\begin_inset Formula $2$
\end_inset

 and this conclusion contradicts the hypothesis that they have no common
 factor.
 Thus the measure 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

 is not a rational number.
 There exists, therefore a point on the number-axis not corresponding to
 any rational number.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Again , we take a point 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 on the line such that the length 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 is any rational multiple say, 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

, of 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The length 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

 cannot have a rational measure.
 For, if possible, let 
\begin_inset Formula $m/n$
\end_inset

 be the measure of 
\begin_inset Formula $OL$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\therefore\qquad\frac{p}{q}\sqrt{2}=\frac{m}{n}\mbox{ or }\sqrt{2}=\frac{mq}{np},
\]

\end_inset

which states that 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 is a rational number, being equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $mq/np$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a contradiction.
 Hence 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 cannot correspond to a rational number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus we see that there exist an unlimited number of points on the number-axis
 which do not correspond to rational numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If we now require that our aggregate of numbers should be such that after
 the choice of unit length on the line, every point of the line should have
 a number corresponding to it (or that 
\emph on
every length should be capable of measurement
\emph default
), we are forced to extend our system of numbers further by the introduction
 of what are called 
\emph on
irrational numbers
\emph default

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We will thus associate an irrational number to every point of the line which
 does not correspond to a rational number.

\begin_layout Standard
Let

 We now seek to obtain the decimal representation of the number associated
 with the point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with, we suppose that the point

\begin_layout Standard
Now, if

 coincides with a point of division, it corresponds to an integer and we
 need proceed no further.
 In case 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 falls between two points of division, say 
\begin_inset Formula $a,a+1$
\end_inset

, we sub-divide the interval 
\begin_inset Formula $(a,a+1)$
\end_inset

 into 
\begin_inset Formula $10$
\end_inset

 equal parts so that the length of each part is 
\begin_inset Formula $\frac{1}{10}$
\end_inset

 The points of division, now, are,
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
a,a+\frac{1}{10},a+\frac{2}{10},\ldots,a+\frac{9}{10},a+1.

\end_inset

\begin_layout Standard
The point P will either coincide with one of the above points of division

\begin_inset Formula $a_{2}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 and continue to repeat the process.
 After a number of steps, say 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

, the point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 will either be found to coincide with some point of division (in this case
 it corresponds to a rational number) or lie between two points of the form
\begin_inset Formula

\begin_layout Standard
This point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
Conversely
\emph default
, consider any infinite decimal
\begin_inset Formula

and construct the series of intervals
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\left[a,a+1\right],\left[a+\frac{a_{1}}{10},a+\frac{a_{1}+1}{10}\right],\left[a+\frac{a_{1}}{10}+\frac{a_{2}}{10^{2}},a+\frac{a_{1}}{10}+\frac{a_{2}+1}{10^{2}}\right],\cdots
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Each of these intervals lies within the preceding one; their lengths go
 on diminishing and by taking 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 sufficiently large we can make the length as near to zero as we like.
 We thus see that these intervals shrink to a point.
 This fact is related to the intuitively perceived aspect of the continuity
 of a straight line.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus there is one and only one point common to this series of intervals

Any two rational numbers may be combined in four distinct ways, referred

 Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division.
 These operations can always be carried out to one definite result, with
 the single exception of division by

 meaningless process; the four processes also obey a number of simple laws,

\begin_layout Remark*
All the known rules of arithmetic, — and hence ultimately all mathematical
 results, — are deduced from these few laws, with the help of the laws of
 pure logic alone.
 Among these laws, one is distinguished by its primarily mathematical character,
 namely the
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Law of Induction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This may be reckoned among the fundamental laws of arithmetic and is normally
 stated as follows: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If a set of natural numbers 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 includes the number 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, and if, every time a certain natural number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 and all those less than 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 can be taken to belong to the aggregate, the number 
\begin_inset Formula $(n+1)$
\end_inset

 may be inferred also to belong to it, then 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 includes all the natural numbers.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This law of induction itself follows quite easily from the following theorem,
 which appears even more obvious and is therefore normally called the fundamenta
l law of the natural numbers:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection*
Law of Natural Numbers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In every set of natural numbers that is not “empty” there is always a number
 less than all the rest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For if, according to the hypotheses of the Induction Law, we consider the
 set 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{N}$
\end_inset

 of natural numbers not belonging to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 , this set must be “empty”, that is, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

 must contain all the natural numbers.
 For otherwise, by the law of the natural numbers, 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{N}$
\end_inset

 would include a number less than all the rest.
 This least number would exceed 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

, for it was assumed that 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 belongs to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

; hence it could be denoted by 
\begin_inset Formula $n+1$
\end_inset

.
 Then 
\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 would belong to 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathfrak{M}$
\end_inset

, but 
\begin_inset Formula $(n+1)$
\end_inset

 would not, which contradicts the hypotheses in the law of induction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In applications it is usually an advantage to be able to make statements
 not merely about the natural numbers but about any whole numbers.
 The laws then take the following forms, obviously equivalent to those above:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on

 If a statement involves a natural number 
\begin_inset Formula $n$

\end_inset

, then 
\begin_inset Formula $2n>n^{3}$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
a) this statement is correct for n = p, and 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
b) its correctness for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=p,p+1,\ldots,k$
\end_inset

 (where 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 is any natural number 
\begin_inset Formula $\geqq p$
\end_inset

) always implies its correctness for 
\begin_inset Formula $n=k+1$
\end_inset

, then the statement is correct for every natural number 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq p$

\emph on
Law of Integers
\emph default

 In every set of integers all

 numbers, of immediate proof, although it becomes axiomatic in character
 very soon after this domain is left.

If

\begin_inset Formula $n$
\end_inset

 always exists such that 
\begin_inset Formula $nb>a$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The four ways of combining two rational numbers give in every case as the
 result another rational number.
 In this sense the system of rational numbers forms a closed aggregate.
 This property of forming a closed system with respect to the four rules
 is obviously not possessed by the aggregate of all natural numbers, or
 of all positive and negative integers.
 These are, so to speak, too sparsely sown to meet all the demands which
 the four rules make upon them.

 it, are then all that we regard as given, known, secured.

\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $-r<a<r$
\end_inset

 are exactly equivalent; similarly for 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|x-a\right|<r$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a-r<x<a+r$
\end_inset

\begin_layout Proof
of the first relation in 4: 
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\pm a & \leq & \left|a\right|\\
\pm b & \leq & \left|b\right|
\end{eqnarray*}

\end_inset

adding the two inequalities gives
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\pm\left(a+b\right)\leq\left|a\right|+\left|b\right|,
\]

\end_inset

and hence 
\begin_inset Formula $\left|a+b\right|\leq\left|a\right|+\left|b\right|$

\begin_layout Subsection
Representation of rational numbers by points along a line.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The mode of representing rational numbers by points along a line or by segments
 of a line, which may be known as the 
\emph on
number axis
\emph default
, will now be explained.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We start with marking an arbitrary point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 on the number axis and calling it the 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
 or zero point.
 The number zero will be represented by the point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The point 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 divides the number axis into two parts or sides.
 Any one of these may be called positive and the other, then negative.
 Usually, the number axis is drawn parallel to the printed lines of the
 page and the right hand side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is termed positive and the left hand side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 negative.

On the positive side, we take an arbitrary length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

, and call it the 
\emph on
unit
\emph default
 length.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

We say, then, that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $1$
\end_inset

 is represented by the point 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

After having fixed an 
\emph on
origin
\emph default
, 
\emph on
positive sense
\emph default
 and a 
\emph on
unit length
\emph default
 on the number axis in the manner indicated above, we are in a position
 to determine a point representing any given rational number as explained
 below :--
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Positive integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we consider any positive integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
 We take a point on the positive side of the line such that its distance
 from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times the unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

.
 This point will be reached by measuring successively 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 steps each equal to 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

 starting from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

.
 This point, then, is said to represent the positive integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Negative integers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To represent a negative integer,
\begin_inset Formula $-m$
\end_inset

, we take a point on the negative side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 such that its distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 times the unit length 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

This point represents the negative integer, 
\begin_inset Formula $-m$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Fractions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, let 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 be any fraction ; 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 being a positive integer.
 Let 
\begin_inset Formula $OA$
\end_inset

 be divided into 
\begin_inset Formula $q$
\end_inset

 equal parts; 
\begin_inset Formula $OB$
\end_inset

 being one of them.
 We take a point on the positive or negative side of 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 according as 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is positive or negative such that its distance from 
\begin_inset Formula $O$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 times (or, 
\begin_inset Formula $-p$
\end_inset

 times if 
\begin_inset Formula $p$
\end_inset

 is negative) the distance 
\begin_inset Formula $OB$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The point so obtained represents the fraction, 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If a point 
\begin_inset Formula $P$
\end_inset

 represents a rational number 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

, then the measure of the length 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

 is clearly 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 or 
\begin_inset Formula $-p/q$
\end_inset

 according as the number is positive or negative.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Sometimes we say that the number 
\begin_inset Formula $p/q$
\end_inset

 is represented by the segment 
\begin_inset Formula $OP$
\end_inset

.

The third of the stipulations by means of which we here characterise the
 concept of number is fulfilled, moreover, as a consequence of the first
 and second.
 For our purposes, this fact is not essential; but as it is significant
 from a systematic point of view, we briefly indicate its proof as follows.
 By §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sec:Ordered-Fields."

\end_inset

 2 and §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:fla"

\end_inset

(subtraction), there is an element for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+\zeta=\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 From the fundamental laws of addition §
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:fla"

\end_inset

, it then quite easily follows that 
\emph on
one and the same element
\emph default
 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 satisfies 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha+\zeta=\alpha$
\end_inset

, for every 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

.
 This element, with all elements equal to it, is called the 
\emph on
neutral
\emph default
 element relatively to the process of addition, or for brevity the ``zero''
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 If 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha$
\end_inset

 is different from this ``zero'', there is, further, an element 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 for which 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha\theta=\alpha$
\end_inset

; and it again appears thit this element is the same as that satisfying
 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta\xi=\beta$
\end_inset

 for any other 
\begin_inset Formula $\beta$
\end_inset

 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 This 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

, with all elements equal to it, is called the 
\emph on
neutral
\emph default
 element relatively to the process of multiplication, or, briefly, the ``unit''
 in 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 The elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 produced bv repeated addition or subtraction of this ``unit'', and any
 others equal to them, are then called ``integers'' of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

.
 All further elements of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 (and all equal to them) which result fiom these by the process of division
 then form the sub-system 
\begin_inset Formula $S'$
\end_inset

 of 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

 in question; that it is 
\emph on
similar
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
isomorphic
\emph default
 to the system of all rational numbers is in fact easily deduced from §

LatexCommand ref

\begin_inset CommandInset ref
